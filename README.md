# beppes-tekton-catalog

This repository contains a collection of Tekton tasks i use. 
Most of these are taken from the tekton catalog project (https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog). Some of these are edited versions of tasks from the tekton catalog project, and a few of these created completely manually.
